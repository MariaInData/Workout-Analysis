# Goal of Project
I find the intersection of humans and data fascinating. It's why I started my analytics journey. Wanting to develop my analytics skills further, I exported my workout information, cleaned and transformed the dataset, and visualized the data in Google's Looker Studio. Analyzing the data that I built workout dashboards for my family and friends was fun.

# Project Impact
Now,  I can quickly analyze my workouts and confirm how much I like cycling. Beyond that, I used Looker Studio for the first time and cleaned an XML file (commonly used across the internet for data transfer).

# Overview of the Process
1. Export data from iphone
- I easily pulled my workouts from the Health App. The Health App exports a XML file.
2. Clean and transform data in Python
- After doing data cleaning and transformation, I did some quick exploratory data. I was initially going to build a dashboard in Jupyter until I realized it's much faster to export and develop a dashboard in Looker Studio.

3. Exported data into Google's Looker Studio to make  a dashboard
-  This was my first time using the Looker Studio. I just found out it existed before starting this project. The Looker Studio is intuitive and has excellent documentation. It was relatively easy to get the graphs I wanted to be displayed. Also, there are styling templates that help get the right aesthetics.

4. Scaled the dashboard
- Showing off my analysis to my family and friends, I was able to scale up my work. Others wanted a dashboard to analyze their workouts. Building everyone else's dashboard took less than 20 minutes as the Python script was already written, and the dashboard could be copied using their workout data. I'm happy to help others learn more about their workouts (and, hopefully, convert them into cyclist enthusiasts!)
