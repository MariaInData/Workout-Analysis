# Goal of Project
I find the intersection of humans and data fascinating. It's why I started my analytics journey. Wanting to further develop my analytics skills, I exported my workout information, cleaned and transformed the dataset, and visualized the data in Google's Looker Studio. It was so fun analyzing my own data that I ended up building workout dashboards for my family and friends

# Project Impact
Now,  I can quickly analyze my workouts and confirm how much I like cycling. Beyond that, I used Looker Studio for the first time and cleaned a XML file (commonly used acrosss the internet for data transfer).

# Overview of the Process
1. Export data from iphone
- I easily pulled my workouts from the Health App. The Health App exports a XML file.
2. Clean and transform data in Python
- After doing data cleaning and transformation, I did some quick exploratory data. I was originally going to build a dashboard in Jupyter until I realized that it's much quicker to export and build a dashboard in Looker Studio.

3. Exported data into Google's Looker Studio to make  a dashboard
-  This was my first time usign the Looker Studio. I didn't know it existed before starting this project. The Looker Studio is pretty inutitive and has great documentation. It was relatively easy to get the graphs I wanted displayed. Also, there are styling templates which is helpful to get the right aesthetics.

4. Scaled the dashboard
- Showing off my analysis to my family and friends, I was able to scale up my work. Others wanted a dashboard to analyze their workouts. It took less than 20 minutes to build everyone else's dashboard as the Python script was already written and the dashboard could be copied using their workout data. I'm happy to help others learn more about their workouts (and hopefully convert them into cyclist enthusiasts!)
