# Goal of Project
I find the intersection of humans and data fascinating. It's why I started my analytics journey. Wanting to further develop my analytics skills, I exported my workout information, cleaned and transformed the dataset, and visualized the data in Google's Looker Studio. It was so fun analyzing my own data that I ended up building workout dashboards for my family and friends

# Project Impact
Now,  I can quickly analyze my workouts and confirm how much I like cycling. Beyond that, I used Looker Studio for the first time and cleaned a XML file (commonly used acrosss the internet for data transfer).

# Overview of the Process
1. Export data from iphone

2. Clean and transform data in Python
- After doing data cleaning and transformation, I did some quick exploratory data. I was originally going to build a dashboard in Jupyter until I realized that it's much quicker to export and build a dashboard in Looker Studio

3. Exported data into Google's Looker Studio to make  a dashboard
